## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (edition 2021)
- [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)
- Ubuntu (or any Linux distribution)
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) ‚Äì [Installation Instructions](https://cli.github.com/)

### Clone the Repository

If you haven‚Äôt already, clone the repository (once it‚Äôs live on GitHub):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saintpetejackboy/pylon.git
cd pylon
```

---

## Configuration

### Configuration File

- **config_default.toml**: Provides the default configuration.
- **config.toml**: This is generated on first run if missing.  
  **Note:** It is safe to leave your actual `config.toml` in the project directory as long as you add it to your `.gitignore`. This prevents sensitive data (such as tokens) from being pushed to GitHub.

Your `.gitignore` already includes:

```
/target
config.toml
```

This means your local configuration will **not** be committed.

## Building & Running

### Build a Static Binary

To compile a release binary for Linux using MUSL, run:

```bash
cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```

The binary will be located at:  
`target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/pylon`

### Run the Application

After building, you can run the application:

```bash
./target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/pylon
```

The server will automatically select an available port (default is `6989`), and you can view the dashboard by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` in your web browser.

## Deploying with GitHub CLI

Assuming your local project is in `/home/jack/pylon`, here‚Äôs how to create a new public repository called **pylon** on GitHub using your CLI, then push your code.

1. **Navigate to your project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd /home/jack/pylon
   ```

2. **Create the repository using `gh`:**

   ```bash
   gh repo create saintpetejackboy/pylon --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
   ```

   This command will:
   - Create a new public repository on GitHub under your username.
   - Set your local repository‚Äôs remote to `origin`.
   - Push your current code to the remote repository.

3. **If you need to initialize Git manually (if not already initialized):**

   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit of Pylon Dashboard"
   gh repo create saintpetejackboy/pylon --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
   ```

4. **Verify that everything is working:**

   Open your browser to `https://github.com/saintpetejackboy/pylon` to see your repository.
